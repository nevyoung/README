<h1>Nev's Ted Talk</h1>
<p>Most of my self expression is in the form of creativity. In order to express who I truly am I use personal art forms to feel whole.</p>
<p>I love to paint and draw in order to express myself in more of an artistic and colorful form.</p>
<p>Memories hold a special place in my heart...they are snapshots of what could be the happiest moments of my life...Without them I don't think I would be able to love things in life as much as I do right now.</p>

<p>My life is in all sorts of chaos so I'm constantly in need of an escape. However, while I may feel like the matter will run wild without control, here are some simple things that I love that keep me sane and enjoying life.</p>

<p>This universe right here is a universe I've lived in my whole life. Ever since I was little, I just loved the idea of fantasy</p>
<p>and the possibility of becoming something superhuman. Of course as a little kid, dreaming of having superpowers and other worldly skills</p>
<p>was almost expected. However, coming from someone a little girl? That was a little peculiar. Thanks to my dad, I became the "son" he always wanted, just with feminine features.</p>

<p>Moving on to the next simple happiness...cartoons. I love watching cartoons. Whether it be shows or movies or shorts, I love watching them. </p>
<p>I remember when I was a kid I would watch all of these and I wouold be in my own little happy place as I watched them.</p>
<p>Still to this day I'm like a little kid again when these shows come on.</p>
